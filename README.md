/r/dogecoin Giveaway Alert Bot
==================

v1.0

reddit bot that looks for giveaway posts on /r/dogecoin.

Simply searches through new posts on /r/dogecoin and check if the post's title has a 'Giveaway' flair. If it does, the bot sends an email to the address specified in the config.ini file. Uses a local praw.ini file to log in to reddit.

Usage notes:
Remove the 'default_' part from the .ini filenames and fill in the necessary fields like reddit credentials and such.
